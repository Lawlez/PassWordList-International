# Lists - a collection of (localized) password / username / wordlists for international use.

Often passwordlists are using mostly english words and passwords to try and crack an exceedingly international audience, with this list i wanted to start to get a higher quality of foreign and international words usernames and common passwords. This lists contains very up to date versions of Top Passwords used in Switzerland, Germany, Austria, England, Italy, The Netherlands and France as well as some general ones and the EU Uberlist. Feel free to submit your local lists as a PR!

The Passwords directory will hold a number of password lists that can be used by multiple tools when attempting to guess credentials for a given targeted service. This will include some popular lists or links to them. Localized lists are marked with the corresponding country code to make the search easier.
